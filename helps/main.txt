version â€” simple multi-source project version management tool
Usage:
  version [global-flags]                # same as: version get
  version <command> [args...] [sources] # run subcommand
  version <command> --help              # show subcommand help

Commands:
  get      Fetch versions from configured sources and compare / print values
  set      Write a specific version to configured sources
  bump     Read, increment, write back and print new version
  max      Choose the maximum version from provided values/sources

Global flags:
  -h, --help         Show this help and exit.
  -s, --strict       Enable strict mode: any source reporting lower-than-max
                     is an error.
                     By default strict mode is disabled
                     (allows some sources to be lower).

Notes:
  - If you run `version` without a subcommand, it behaves as `version get`.
  - Sources are configured via version.toml or the [tool.version] table in
    pyproject.toml.
  - Source names are CamelCase identifiers
    (e.g. "Git", "PackageJson", "PyProject").
