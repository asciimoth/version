version set <version> [Source...]
Write the given semver into configured sources.

Usage:
  version set 1.2.3
  version set 1.2.3 PackageJson PyProject
  version set v1.2.3 Git

Behavior:
  - For each target source:
      - Update the file/key/regexp or write a new git tag (for git source)
        with the new version.
      - Respect each source's VPrefix policy:
          - true  => force leading 'v' when writing a tag/value.
          - false => write naked semver without 'v'.
          - auto  => preserve existing style for that source, or
            cahoose sensible default.
  - If a file/source is marked read-only (either in config or via --readonly),
    it will be skipped.

Flags:
  -s, --strict  Treat any source that reports a lower version than the
                maximum as an error.

Examples:
  version set 2.0.0
  version set 2.0.0 PackageJson Cargo
  version set 2.0.0 --strict
