version get [--help] [--strict] [fallback-or-part] [Source...] [none]
Fetch and compare versions from sources.
Default behavior:
  - Read versions from all configured sources
    (or the built-in defaults if no config).
  - If all non-ignored sources agree, print the version.
  - If they disagree:
      - In non-strict mode: print a summary to stderr and exit 2.
      - In strict mode: treat any non-equal lower value as an error and exit 2.

Usage examples:
  version get
  version get Git PackageJson
  # use "1.2.3" as fallback (if no source has a value)
  version get 1.2.3
  # ignore all sources, use 1.2.3
  version get 1.2.3 none
  # print only the minor component (e.g. for 1.2.3 -> "2")
  version get minor
  # print patch component only, but only check Git
  version get patch Git

Arguments:
  Source names (optional)   Names of sources to check (e.g. Git, PackageJson).
   If omitted, all configured/default sources are used.
  fallback-or-part (optional)
    - literal semver "X.Y.Z" — used as fallback if no source contains a version
    - one of "major", "minor", "patch" — print only that component.

Flags:
  -s, --strict  Treat any source that reports a lower version than the
                maximum as an error.
                (Useful in CI when you need strict parity.)
