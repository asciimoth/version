version bump [<major|minor|patch>|<semver>] [Source...]
Read the current version(s), increment as requested, write back to sources, and print the new version.

Default:
  - If no increment argument given, bump the minor component (semantic default).
  - After bumping, the new version is written to all non-read-only selected sources.

Usage examples:
  # bump minor of version fetched from sources (e.g. 1.2.3 -> 1.3.0)
  version bump
  version bump major   # bump major (e.g. 1.2.3 -> 2.0.0)
  version bump patch Git # Use only git source
  # ignore all sources, use 1.2.3 as base, print 1.3.0
  version bump 1.2.3 none

Flags:
  -s, --strict     Fail if any selected source reports a lower-than-max value
                   (see strict semantics).

Output:
  - Prints the newly produced version to stdout (e.g. `1.3.0`) on success.
  - Writes diagnostic messages to stderr on partial failures.
